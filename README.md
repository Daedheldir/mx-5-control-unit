# This is work in progress!
Android app and an OBDII Arduino controller for my Mazda MX-5, used to control exhaust valves and allow for some automation. Communication between android application and arduino achieved using HC-05 module (Bluetooth 2.0). This module will be later exchanged for HC-10 (BT 4.0LE) and HC-05 module will be used for communication with OBD2 reader based on ELM327 chip.
Exhaust valves are controlled with a relay and an IRF520 MOSFET driver module.
